By being bidirectional, the BiLSTM can capture both past and future context, allowing it to effectively model temporal dependencies in the sequence of image features. This is crucial for detecting patterns indicative of deepfake manipulation, which may manifest over time in videos or sequences of images.
14. **Question:** How did you handle the integration of the ResNeXt-50 model and the BiLSTM layer in your overall model architecture?
    **Answer:** The output from the ResNeXt-50 model was fed into the BiLSTM layer as sequential input data. Each feature vector outputted by the ResNeXt-50 model represented a time step in the sequence, with the BiLSTM layer processing these vectors sequentially to capture temporal dependencies.
